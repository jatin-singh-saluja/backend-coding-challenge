# Deploying the Dockerized Application in AWS Cloud

To deploy the app, we build the Docker image, push it to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and deploy it to ECS Fargate by creating a task definition and a cluster. Alternatively, we could also deploy it to AWS Lambda with API Gateway integration.

## Go for AWS Fargate if:

1. We need more control over the container environment and resource allocation.
2. We have long-running, complex, or resource-intensive applications.

## Monitoring, Logging and Health Checks

1. Configure your task definition to send logs to Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring.

2. Create CloudWatch alarms for metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and errors.

3. Set up Slack notifications with cloudwatch and SNS to alert you in case of issues in dev and prod environments.

4. Integrate AWS X-Ray for tracing requests and analyzing the performance of your applications. It helps in identifying performance bottlenecks and errors.

5. For AWS ECS, configure the ALB to perform health checks on your ECS tasks. This ensures that traffic is only routed to healthy instances. Add a health check endpoint in your Flask application.


## Strategies to Mitigate API Abuse

1. Rate limiting: For AWS Lambda with API Gateway, we could use API Gateway Throttling. And for ECS, we could use AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) to create rate-based rules.

2. Authentication and authorization.

3. Bot protection with AWS WAF Bot Control, and CAPTCHA implementation.

4. Data Validation.

## Response Caching with External API

    It can be acheived using Cloudfront or Redis.
